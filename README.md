# Data-Science-with-Numpy

## Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other frameworks have made machine learning and deep learning modeling more accessible. However, for beginners, using these frameworks often makes it difficult to deepen their understanding of the models. This project implements a series of common algorithms using Numpy, serving both as a record of the author's daily learning and as a reference for beginners in the field. The author is also a beginner and mistakes are inevitable. Feedback and discussions are welcome!
